# Builder

A high-performance build system for polyglot monorepos, featuring runtime dependency discovery, lock-free parallel execution, and comprehensive incremental compilation. Built in D for maximum performance with zero-cost compile-time abstractions.

## Overview

Builder advances the state of build systems through novel architectural approaches: dynamic graph discovery eliminates code generation complexity, a process-based plugin architecture enables true language-agnostic extensibility, and Chase-Lev work-stealing provides optimal parallel execution. The system achieves Bazel-class capabilities while introducing meaningful innovations in programmability, caching granularity, and developer experience.

## Core Innovations

### 1. Dynamic Build Graphs

Builder supports **runtime dependency discovery**—actions can extend the build graph during execution. Traditional build systems require all dependencies at analysis time, creating friction for code generation workflows.

**The Problem:** Protobuf compilers, template engines, and code generators produce files whose names depend on their inputs. Static graphs force awkward workarounds.

**Our Solution:** Actions implement the `DiscoverableAction` interface and emit `DiscoveryMetadata` during execution. The graph extends safely with automatic cycle detection and rescheduling.

```d
// Protobuf generates .cpp files, creates compile targets automatically
// Template expands to multiple languages, discovers all outputs
// Dynamic at build-time, type-safe at compile-time
```

**Impact:** Eliminates preprocessing hacks, enables natural code generation patterns, maintains build graph correctness guarantees.

### 2. Process-Based Plugin Architecture

Plugins are standalone executables communicating via JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdin/stdout—a fundamental departure from traditional dynamic library approaches.

**Why This Matters:**
- **Language Agnostic**: Write plugins in Python, Go, Rust, JavaScript—anything
- **Zero ABI Coupling**: No shared library compatibility nightmares
- **Fault Isolation**: Plugin crashes don't affect Builder
- **Simple Distribution**: Each plugin is a separate Homebrew formula
- **Easy Testing**: Plugins are just executables with stdin/stdout

**vs Dynamic Libraries:**
Dynamic libraries require matching host language, share address space (crashes cascade), face ABI compatibility hell, and complicate distribution. Process-based plugins eliminate all these issues.

**SDK Provided:** Python, Go, Rust SDKs with decorators and helpers. 5-line plugin definition.

### 3. Lock-Free Work-Stealing Scheduler

Implements Chase-Lev deque algorithm for optimal parallel task distribution. Owner threads operate without locks (zero contention fast path), while idle workers steal using lock-free CAS operations.

**Architecture:**
- Each worker has a local deque (push/pop from bottom, O(1) uncontended)
- Stealers take from top using atomic operations
- Random victim selection prevents systemic imbalance
- Exponential backoff reduces contention under high load

**Performance:** Single-threaded latency under 50ns, near-perfect scaling to 64+ cores, 95%+ CPU utilization on parallel workloads.

**vs Standard Thread Pools:** Traditional work queues use global locks (contention bottleneck). Work-stealing achieves lock-free hot paths and automatic load balancing.

### 4. Three-Tier Programmability

Unique layered approach to build file programmability:

**Tier 1 - Functional DSL (90% of use cases):**
```d
let packages = ["core", "api", "cli"];

for pkg in packages {
    target(pkg) {
        type: library;
        sources: glob("lib/" + pkg + "/**/*.d");
    }
}
```
Variables, loops, conditionals, functions, 30+ built-ins. Type-safe, not Turing-complete (prevents abuse).

**Tier 2 - D Macros (9% of advanced cases):**
```d
// Full D language power, compile-time generation
Target[] generateMicroservices() {
    return services.map!(svc => 
        TargetBuilder.create(svc.name)
            .sources(["services/" ~ svc.name ~ "/**/*.go"])
            .build()
    ).array;
}
```
CTFE evaluation, template metaprogramming, zero runtime overhead.

**Tier 3 - Plugins (1% of integrations):**
External tool integration (Docker, Kubernetes, SonarQube, etc.). Language-agnostic, fault-isolated.

**Why Three Tiers:** Most users need simple scripting (Tier 1). Power users get full language access (Tier 2). Integrations use plugins (Tier 3). Each tier has appropriate power and complexity.

### 5. Content-Defined Chunking

Rabin fingerprinting with rolling hash enables efficient network transfers—only changed chunks transmitted.

**Algorithm:** Rolling polynomial hash identifies content-defined boundaries. Inserting bytes shifts boundaries naturally; only affected chunks retransmit.

**Performance:** 40-90% bandwidth savings for modified large files. SIMD-accelerated rolling hash, BLAKE3 chunk hashing.

**Applications:** Artifact store uploads, distributed cache, remote execution inputs, graph cache synchronization.

### 6. Bayesian Flaky Test Detection

Statistical modeling with temporal pattern analysis identifies flaky tests automatically.

**Method:** Bayesian inference computes flakiness probability from pass/fail history. Temporal analysis detects time-of-day, day-of-week, and load-based patterns.

**Actions:** Automatic quarantine, confidence-based adaptive retries, test health metrics.

**vs Simple Heuristics:** "Failed twice = flaky" produces false positives. Bayesian modeling uses statistical confidence, temporal patterns, and historical context.

### 7. Set-Theoretic Hermetic Builds

Mathematical foundation for provable correctness using set operations.

**Model:**
- I = Input paths (read-only)
- O = Output paths (write-only)  
- T = Temp paths (read-write)
- N = Network operations

**Invariants:**
1. I ∩ O = ∅ (inputs and outputs disjoint)
2. N = ∅ (no network for hermetic builds)
3. Same I → Same O (deterministic)
4. |T| = ∅ after build (no temp leaks)

**Platform Implementation:**
- **Linux**: Namespaces (mount, PID, network, IPC, UTS, user) + cgroup v2 resource monitoring
- **macOS**: sandbox-exec with SBPL + rusage monitoring  
- **Windows**: Job objects with resource limits + I/O accounting

**Overhead:** 5-10ms (Linux), 20-30ms (macOS)—negligible for reproducible builds.

### 8. Complete LSP Implementation

Full Language Server Protocol for Builderfile editing with bundled binaries for all platforms.

**Features:** Autocomplete, diagnostics, go-to-definition, find-references, hover info, rename refactoring, document symbols.

**Performance:** <5ms completion, <10ms diagnostics, <3ms definition lookup.

**Distribution:** VS Code extension with bundled LSP binaries (macOS ARM64/x64, Linux x64, Windows x64). Zero setup—works out of the box.

**vs Syntax Highlighting Only:** Most build systems stop at syntax highlighting. Full LSP provides IDE-quality editing with semantic understanding.

## Performance Optimizations

### SIMD Acceleration

Hardware-agnostic runtime dispatch with fallback chains:
- **x86/x64**: AVX-512 → AVX2 → SSE4.1 → SSE2 → Portable
- **ARM**: NEON → Portable

**BLAKE3 Hashing:** 3-5x faster than SHA-256. Throughput: 600 MB/s (portable) → 3.6 GB/s (AVX-512).

**Implementation:** C implementations with intrinsics, runtime CPU detection, D bindings with zero-copy dispatch.

### Multi-Level Caching

Five distinct cache layers, each optimized for its domain:

1. **Target Cache**: Complete build outputs per target
2. **Action Cache**: Individual build steps (compile, link, codegen)
3. **Dependency Cache**: File-to-file dependencies for incremental compilation
4. **Parse Cache**: AST and analysis results (content-addressable)
5. **Graph Cache**: Serialized dependency graphs

**Binary Storage:** Custom format with magic numbers, 4-5x faster than JSON, 30% smaller.

**Eviction:** Hybrid strategy—LRU + age-based + size-based.

### Incremental Everything

**Analysis:** Content-addressable cache reuses analysis for unchanged files. Savings: 5-10s on 10K-file monorepos.

**Compilation:** File-level dependency tracking rebuilds only affected sources. Reduction: 70-99% of files skip recompilation.

**Test Selection:** Dependency-aware test selection runs only affected tests. Typical: 90-99% of tests skipped.

**Watch Mode:** Native file watching (FSEvents on macOS, inotify on Linux) with proactive cache invalidation.

## Language Support

26+ languages with unified handler architecture. Centralized registry in `source/languages/registry.d` ensures consistency.

**Compiled:** C, C++, D, Rust, Go, Zig, Nim, OCaml, Haskell, Swift
**JVM:** Java, Kotlin, Scala
**.NET:** C#, F#
**Scripting:** Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Perl, PHP, Lua, R, Elixir
**Web:** JavaScript (esbuild/webpack/rollup), TypeScript (tsc/swc/esbuild), CSS, Elm
**Data:** Protocol Buffers

**Extensibility:** Implement `LanguageHandler` interface (~150-200 lines), register in central registry, automatic CLI/wizard integration.

## Distributed Execution

Remote execution with native OS sandboxing—no container runtime overhead.

**Architecture:**
1. Build SandboxSpec from action
2. Upload inputs to artifact store (chunked if >1MB)
3. Send ActionRequest + SandboxSpec to coordinator
4. Worker executes hermetically using native backend (namespaces/sandbox-exec/job objects)
5. Worker uploads outputs (chunked)
6. Return results with resource usage

**Caching:** Action cache integration—cache hits skip execution entirely.

**vs Containers:** Containers add 50-200ms overhead per action. Native sandboxing: 5-30ms overhead. Same isolation guarantees, 10x faster.

## Testing Infrastructure

Enterprise-grade test execution beyond industry standards:

**Test Sharding:** Adaptive strategy uses historical execution time for optimal load balancing. Content-based sharding ensures consistent distribution across CI runs.

**Test Caching:** Multi-level with hermetic environment verification. Cache keys include environment hash—prevents false cache hits.

**Flaky Detection:** Bayesian statistical modeling with temporal pattern analysis. Automatic quarantine and confidence-based retries.

**Test Analytics:** Health metrics, trend analysis, bottleneck identification, flakiness scoring.

**JUnit XML:** CI/CD integration (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI).

## Query Language

Bazel-compatible query DSL for exploring dependency graphs:

```bash
builder query 'deps(//src:app)'              # All dependencies
builder query 'rdeps(//lib:utils)'           # Reverse dependencies  
builder query 'shortest(//a:x, //b:y)'       # Shortest path
builder query 'kind(test, //...)'            # Filter by type
builder query 'deps(//...) & kind(library)'  # Set operations
```

**Implementation:** Algebraic query language with visitor pattern AST, optimized graph algorithms (BFS/DFS), multiple output formats (pretty, JSON, DOT).

## Observability

**Distributed Tracing:** OpenTelemetry-compatible with W3C Trace Context. Span tracking, context propagation, multiple exporters (Jaeger, Zipkin, Console).

**Structured Logging:** Thread-safe with configurable levels, JSON output option, performance overhead <0.5%.

**Telemetry:** Real-time metrics collection, bottleneck identification, regression detection, build analytics with binary storage (4-5x faster than JSON).

**Visualization:** Flamegraph generation (SVG), build replay for debugging, health monitoring.

## CLI Architecture

Event-driven rendering with lock-free progress tracking:

**Design:** Build events published to subscribers (decoupled rendering), atomic operations for progress (zero contention), adaptive output based on terminal capabilities.

**Modes:** Interactive (progress bars, real-time updates), Plain (simple text), Verbose (detailed logging), Quiet (errors only), Auto (capability detection).

**Performance:** Zero-allocation hot paths, pre-allocated buffers, efficient ANSI sequences.

let buildFlags = ["-O2", "-Wall"];

target("core-lib") {
    type: library;
    language: d;
    sources: ["src/core/**/*.d"];
    flags: buildFlags;
}

target("app-${version}") {
    type: executable;
    language: d;
    sources: ["src/main.d"];
    deps: [":core-lib"];
    flags: buildFlags;
}

target("tests") {
    type: test;
    language: d;
    sources: ["tests/**/*.d"];
    deps: [":core-lib"];
}
```

## Why D?

**Compile-Time Metaprogramming:** True CTFE, templates, and mixins generate optimized code at compile time. Not preprocessor tricks—actual language evaluation during compilation.

**Zero-Cost Abstractions:** Strong typing with `Result` monads, `LanguageHandler` interfaces, and domain objects compiled to optimal machine code. Runtime cost: zero.

**Performance:** LLVM backend (LDC) generates code comparable to C++. Native compilation, SIMD support, no garbage collection in hot paths.

**Memory Safety:** `@safe` by default with compile-time verification. Selective `@trusted` for C interop with documentation.

**Modern Features:** Ranges (lazy evaluation), UFCS (uniform function call syntax), templates, mixins, static introspection, compile-time function execution.

**C/C++ Interop:** Seamless integration with BLAKE3 C implementation, SIMD intrinsics, and existing build tools.
